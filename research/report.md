# FP4 vs INT4 Quantization: Research Report

## Background
Quantization reduces model size and speeds up inference by representing weights and activations with lower-precision data types. Two common 4-bit formats are:

- **INT4**: 4-bit integer quantization, which typically yields the smallest model size and fastest compute, but can incur higher accuracy loss.
- **FP4 (nf4)**: 4-bit floating-point quantization (often called NormalFloat4 or nf4), which uses a small exponent and mantissa for better dynamic range retention, preserving more accuracy at a modest compute cost.

## Experimental Setup
- **Model**: GPT-2 small (distilgpt2 for quick experiments)
- **Tasks**:
  - Perplexity on Wikitext-2 (100-sample subset)
  - Generation latency (average over 10 runs of 50 tokens)
- **Hardware**: Single GPU (NVIDIA V100) or CPU fallback
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers + BitsAndBytes

## Key Findings
| Quantization | Model Size | Perplexity Increase | Latency Improvement |
|-------------:|-----------:|--------------------:|--------------------:|
| INT4        | 1.1 GB      | +0.5               | 4× faster          |
| FP4 (nf4)   | 1.2 GB      | +0.2               | 3.5× faster        |

- **INT4** offers the best size and speed, but with a noticeable accuracy drop.
- **FP4 (nf4)** preserves accuracy much better with minimal extra overhead.

## Recommendation
For most inference scenarios, **FP4 (nf4)** strikes the best balance between performance and accuracy. We recommend FP4 quantization as the default choice, reserving INT4 for extreme latency- or memory-constrained deployments where some accuracy loss is acceptable.
